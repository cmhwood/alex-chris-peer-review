Stretch Goals


Edit Page.
 View at route /edit
 Assumes the selected movie id is in Redux
 Display an input field for changing the movie title
 Displays a textarea for changing the movie description
 Cancel button, which should bring the user to the Details Page
 Save button, which should update the title and description in the database and bring the user to the Details Page
OTHER STRETCH GOALS
 Display the current values in the input (title) and textarea (description) on the Edit Page
 Display all genres on movie list page. Research array_agg to make this possible.
 Move sagas and reducers out of your index.js and into separate files (ideally in src/redux/reducers and src/redux/sagas folders).
 Allow the user to refresh the details or edit page. The url for the details page would be something like /details/1 for movie with id of 1. Research react router params.
 Allow the user to add a genre to a movie.
 Allow the user to remove a genre from a movie.
 Only display the top 10 movies, and allow the user to search for movie titles with a search bar on the home page (you can do this on the client side or the server side, server side is a bigger stretch, but good practice).
 Create an Admin page. Add a link from the Home page to the Admin page. The page should initially display a login form (an input for username and an input for password). When the user enters the correct username (camera) and password (action), the page should display a form to add genres to the database, and a list of all of the genres with an x to remove them from the database.
