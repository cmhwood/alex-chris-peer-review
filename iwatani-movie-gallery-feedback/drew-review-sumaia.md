### General Notes

Hey Sumaia, Great work on this project! The styling is really inviting and super interactive with the hover features. Not 100% sure what the issue with the genre not displaying but I'm sure its just something small you have to fix.

### Notes:

Well done Sumaia! This projects looks great and functions really smoothly, love the styling you did. The genres right now currently do not display so I believe that may need to be fixed

### Notes:

Commit just a little more often! But otherwise well done on formatting and putting in notes. There are a couple lines that are still noted out that cna just be removed as well!
