### Notes:

Notes on General Items--
Riley, I have never been more impressed with your work, this exceeds my expectations on the assignment. I consistently see you improving your coding skills and am widly proud and impressed,
 I also enjoy that you are having fun with your code (admin page delete). The only thing I would possibly cratique would be to leave more code 
 comments to discribe what your code is doing but even-so, your code is really well written and easy to read and I do see SOME code comments but being more consistent over your whole code with leaving comments
  ( just something to consider, but I'm not too worried about. ).
