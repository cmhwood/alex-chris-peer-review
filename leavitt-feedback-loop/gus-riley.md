Notes on General Items

Great work Gus! Using the one reducer to handle the four form submits is very nifty, love it. Overall everything looks and works great and as expected. Maybe some things to look into are, form validation for each of the survey components, rendering the users input into the form when they go back to a previous form input, code comments & commits, and a README.md.
