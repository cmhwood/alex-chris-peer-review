Hey Noah,

General Feedback. Don't forget to include good things first! 

---
| Functional Requirements | Complete |
| --- | :---: |
| Multi page form with client side routing and navigation (next button) | yes |
| Data stored in Redux when navigating from page to page | yes |
| User is notified when trying to leave a blank score | no |
| Review Component displays scores and comments from current redux state | yes |
| Submit button sends data to the server via Axios | yes |
| Confirmation Page displays after data is POSTed to the server | yes |
| Button on Confirmation Page starts a new survey | yes |
| Views are broken down into components | yes |

---
### Notes:
Works as it should, a bit more styling and it would look a little better but overall good. It is missing the validation to not let people submit empty strings.

Notes on the above Functional Requirements.

---
| General Items | Complete |
| --- | :---: |
| More than 15 git commits | no |
| Commits are descriptive of the changes made or feature added | yes |
| Readme file updated | no |
| Appropriate amount of code comments | no |
| Code is consistently formatted | no |
| Server code organized with router & module files | yes |
| Dispatch action to clear redux state on new survey | yes |

---
### Notes:
Missing comments and readme isn't update. Some of the code isn't formatted the same, if you flex a `SHIFT + OPTION + F` you can quickly format all the code. Additionally, I only counted 4 missing ';' at the 
end of most of your dispatch action objects. Doesn't hurt anything in JS, but in some other languages this will be a huge pain if you miss semi-colons.

General notes on quality, comments, commits, suggestions, highlights, etc.
