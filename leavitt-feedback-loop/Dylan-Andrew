### Notes:

Notes on the above Functional Requirements:
Great job Dylan! Nice use of the "back" feature of useHistory! Just a couple of comments for clarifying concepts: 

When storing state in redux, since each feedback category has its own store, you do not need to copy the prio state into the object (e.g. : return {...state, comments: action.payload};). This spread operator is for copying previous array contents into a new array. Since the feedback categories in this assignment are singular objects, you only need to return the action.payload. That said, it does still work as-is.

On the review page, the conditional rendering is not needed as you already have input validation for all of the data. There is no circumstance where the user should get to the last page with blank feedback (aside from comments), so there is no need to conditionally render based on whether anything is in the store.

### Notes:

Code and commits looked good! I liked how you filled-out and organized your README as well. I did notice there weren't any comments in the project at all. Probably just means you had a good grasp on everything, but never hurts to have an occasional comment to explain your thought process, etc.
