Hey Garrett,

General Feedback.

---
| Functional Requirements | Complete? |
| --- | :---: |
| Multi page form with client side routing and navigation (next button) | yes |
| Data stored in Redux when navigating from page to page | yes |
| User is notified when trying to leave a blank score | yes |
| Review Component displays scores and comments from current redux state | yes |
| Submit button sends data to the server via Axios | yes |
| Confirmation Page displays after data is POSTed to the server | yes |
| Button on Confirmation Page starts a new survey | yes |
| Views are broken down into components | yes |

---
### Notes:

Everything looks good and functions well. I like that you just used value option for the numbers so people know it's one through five. Buttons at end could be confusing as people might not realize that one goes back to the name and the other doesn't.

| General Items | Complete? |

### Notes:

I would say to add more comments, as while you might understand what is happening on the page, not everyone else will. The readMe looks really good with the pictures and offers a great starting point for people. Good job are the file formating and splitting things up for ease of use.
