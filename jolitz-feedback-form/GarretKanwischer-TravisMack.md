### Notes:

Everything functions well. Great visuals and use of images. Really good file formatting, very consistent, that makes the code easy to read and 
understand even without code comments. Good detail on the ReadMe as far as how the application works and what the user might need to do to get it up and running.

### Notes:

Adding code comments will be helpful to others looking over your code, aswell as your future self if you need/want to make changes. 
Remove items from your imports, at the top of each file, that you don't end up using. Adding example images to the ReadMe can be handy for
giving someone a quick idea of how your app looks and works, without having to run it.

Thanks for sharing you project for me to review, 
  Garret Kanwischer
