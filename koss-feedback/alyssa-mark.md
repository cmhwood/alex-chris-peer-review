### Notes:

Notes on General Items--
This looked great! I personally feel like the navbar could have been more effective at the top of the page but that just comes down to personal preference.
Good use of material UI styling and the sweetalerts on delete.
Also I thought logging in on the admin page was a nice touch. 
The only thing I would say is missing is a date in the table on the admin page, then you can track when the data was left for future reference.
Other than that it looks great! Nice work.
