### Notes:

Hello! I think the only issue is that the post request to the server isn't working. Right now, the redux isn't reseting or pushing the user back to the beginning of the
survey, but I think that it would do that if the post request was working. I cant really tell why it is not working at this time. But each page links well to the next and 
I can see that the redux is being updated correctly. Good job!
