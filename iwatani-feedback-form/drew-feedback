# Weekend Challenge 11 - React-Redux Feedback Form

## Instructions

Reviewing code is an important role developers play. We're going to practice reviewing code from others.

- Get the repo url from your partner
- Get your partner's project running on your computer
- Review the code from your partner and give relevant feedback
- Complete the Markdown section and submit that in the notes section on the assignment app. (Make sure you include who's code you reviewed.)

Practicing compassionate code reviews is important (you can learn more from this video on the topic: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ea8EiIPZvh0 )

## Review Checklist

## Base Required Features

- Multi-Part Form:

  - [x] Able to add feedback
    - [x] Data collected on individual pages & components

    - [x] Actions have a `type` key, and `payload` if sending data
    - [x] Reducers are returning a new state, or the old state (not mutating)
    - [ ] Reducers are using spread correctly (to keep old data, while adding new)
  - [x] Review Component shows at all times with current redux state
  - [x] React-Redux Working

  - [x] Commits are descriptive of the changes made or feature added
  - [x] Has .gitignore with node_modules
  - [x] Readme file updated (assuming this is previously discussed)
- Code Style
  - [ ] Appropriate amount of code comments
  - [x] Code is consistently formatted
- Client
  - [x] Appropriate use of HTML tags
  - [x] Basic CSS styling with margins/padding

## Stretch Goals

First must be complete for score of _5 - Exceeds Expectations_

- Previous Steps

  - [ ] allows a user to go to a previous step, either directly or by cycling backward thru the steps
  - [ ] user can upate their score for a step
    - [ ] new score is validated to not be empty
    - [ ] redux is updated with new score
  - [ ] user can continue on to review page and submit as in Base Mode

- Admin View

  - [ ] All entries are visible with correct data from inputs
    - [ ] Most recent is at the top

    - [ ] User is prompted before deleting
  - [ ] Axios GET request to get all feedback for `/admin` view in componentDidMount

  Busywork Goals, consider removing or making more useful

- [x] Styling with Material UI
- [ ] Ability to flag a feedback item on `/admin` for further review

## Markdown

```
Hey Drew,

Project overall looks awesome, and it seems that you are really understanding the content well and understanding how to implement it. A few quick notes that I have would be to make sure you really use those code comments. I know it can be a tedious task but not only will it help others when looking at your code, but it will help you as well if you are bug fixing as it allows you to see what these lines of code that you wrote are meant to do if you aren't sure!

Also it seems that for you redux, you are not creating new objects, rather updating the previous one. This still works and sends a new object to the server, but redux is not holding all of them that are being created. With that being said you are sending the data to the server correctly and getting the individual objects to be stored on the server correctly.

| Functional Requirements | Complete? |
| YES | :---: |
| Multi page form with client side routing and navigation (next button) | YES |
| Data stored in Redux when navigating from page to page | YES |
| User is notified when trying to leave a blank score | YES |
| Review Component displays scores and comments from current redux state | YES |
| Submit button sends data to the server via Axios | YES |
| Confirmaion Page displays after data is POSTed to the server | YES |
| Button on Confirmation Page clears Redux and starts a new survey | NO |
| Views are broken down into components | YES |

---
### Notes:

Everything looks great except it seems that the redux state is not being cleared, rather it is just taking the old state and replacing the values as you start a new survey. Other than that awesome work!

---
| General Items | Complete? |
| YES | :---: |
| More than 15 git commits | YES |
| Commits are descriptive of the changes made or feature added | YES |
| Readme file updated | YES |
| Appropriate amount of code comments | NO |
| Code is consistently formatted | YES |
| Server code organized with router & module files | YES |

---
### Notes:

I would try to have some more code comments if possible so others and yourself can understand your code better
